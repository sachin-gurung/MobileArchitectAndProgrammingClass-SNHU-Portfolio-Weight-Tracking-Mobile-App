**1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**  
     The app was designed to help users track their weight over time and stay motivated towar their health goals. The main requirements were to provide secure login, allow users to enter and store weight entries, display past entries, store a target weight and notify users when their target goal weight was achieved.
   
**2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**  
     The app required a login screen, a home screen for entering new weights as well as view previous weight entries and a notification feature for goal achievement. The UI was focused on simplicity, clarity and efficiency. I wanted to make sure all tasks are achieved easily with minimal friction. My designs were successful because of it's simple to navigate and has all the necessary functions that is needed for the app without overwhelming UI.
   
**3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**  
     I worked and built one feature at a time and tested it. I used modular coding practice to separate responsibilities such as UI, data storage, notifications etc. This helped me ensure that the codes were manageable and easier to make changes.
   
**4. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**  
     I tested each feature incrementally using the Android emulator and confirmed that user input was correctly stored, displayed and retrieved. I also tested the notification system and the edge cases to ensure that the goal alerts were triggered correctly. This helped me confirm that my app is doing what it's supposed to do.
   
**5. Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**  
     One challenge I had to overcome was how to make the UI both effective and simple. I did it by simplifying the UI pages from multiple to just few and combining features onto the same screen cleanly. This made the app more user-friendly.
   
**6. In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**  
     I was particularly successful in demonstrating my skills with the UI design and database integration. I created a clean design that was user-centered and also implemented persistent data so users can reliably view their progress.
